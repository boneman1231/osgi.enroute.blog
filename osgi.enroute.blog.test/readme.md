# enRoute Blog Manager API Test (OSGi JUnit)
This bundle tests the enRoute Blog Manager API. This is a demonstration of 
the test capabilities and will therefore not show testing but just how testing
can be done in an OSGi build environment.

If you implement the Blog Manager API then you should include this bundle
in your `-runbundles`. Once you've done that, you can:

* In Eclipse — Debug As/Bnd OSGi Test Launcher (JUnit) (or Run As)
* In bnd — 'bnd test'

See, for example, the osgi.enroute.blog.memory.provider
