# enRoute Blog Application
The enRoute Blog Application is the killer app you've always been waiting for! It
is implemented as web service, making it available from everywhere. 

## Disclaimer
This application is the output of a tutorial that builds it from scratch using
[bndtools][1]. For this reason it can not be judged at its usability. Only the
bare minimum of functionality is implemented. However, what is implemented is
intended to show how it should be done.

That said, a Blog Application for single user with no security is obviously not
very useful. Therefore, no claim is made that this does anything useful.
